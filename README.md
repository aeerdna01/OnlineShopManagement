# Online Shop Management
This project is a web-based system for managing an online clothing store. It includes a database for organizing products, completing transactions, and maintaining order history.

## Technologies used
The backend of this project was developed using Python and the Django framework, while the frontend was created with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. An Oracle database was used to store the data, and the Python code interacted with the database through SQL raw queries. 
The project includes also the Data Modeler and SQL Developer scripts, which provide the DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands needed to create, insert, test, and delete the database.

## Features
* User authentication and registration
* Detailed information on products and categories
